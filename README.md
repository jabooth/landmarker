WebGL based 3D annotation tool 

NOTE: This is the repository first used for initial development 
of landmarker.io. As such it contains checked in copies of
whole JS libraries and all sorts of nastiness.

Once I settled on browserify for dependencies I moved the project
to [menpo/landmarker](https://github.com/menpo/landmarker) with
a nice clean starting point.

This repository is kept here for reference purposes only. All issues
and PR's should be made to [menpo/landmarker](https://github.com/menpo/landmarker).
